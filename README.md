🚀 Features
Infinite Gameplay: Randomly generates 4-band resistors (Digits, Multiplier, and Tolerance).
Score & Streak Tracking: Gamifies the learning process to encourage accuracy.
High Contrast Design:
Specifically tuned color palette to ensure Silver (10% tolerance) and Grey (8 digit) are easily distinguishable.
Matte Charcoal used for Grey vs. Bright Metallic for Silver.
Built-in Cheat Sheet: A toggleable reference chart is included directly in the UI for beginners.
Fully Responsive: Works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Zero Dependencies: Built entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or build steps required.

🎮 How to Play
A resistor with 4 colored bands will appear on the screen.
Calculate the resistance value based on the standard color code:
Band 1 & 2: Significant digits.
Band 3: Multiplier.
Band 4: Tolerance.
Select the correct value from the multiple-choice options.
